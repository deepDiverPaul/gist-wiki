A Makefile is provided to automate some tasks.

* `make` will install dependencies via composer and NPM
* `make composer` will install PHP dependencies via composer
* `make npm` will install CSS/JS dependencies via NPM
* `make update` will update the application
* `make clean-cache` will remove the content of the cache directory
* `make propel` will generate propel migrations (database and files)
* `make run` will run development server on http://127.0.0.1:8080/

By default, `composer`, `npm`, `git`, `mkdir` and `php` binaries must be in your `$PATH`. You can override it by using these envars:

* `COMPOSER`
* `NPM`
* `GIT`
* `MKDIR`
* `PHP`

For example:

    $ export COMPOSER=/path/to/composer
    $ make composer
